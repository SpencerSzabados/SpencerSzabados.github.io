I am an incoming PhD student at UBC (2025.09 - Present) within the [PLAI](https://plai.cs.ubc.ca/) lab, and graduate intern at [Inverted AI](https://www.inverted.ai/home). Previously, I was working full time (2024.08 - 2025.08) at [hum.ai](https://hum.ai/) as a Machine Learning Engineer using diffusion models for temporal prediction of earth remote sensing data.

My research interests are centered around generative modeling with an emphasis on diffusion models applied to robotics and computer vision; I'm also interested in a variety of topics within optimization, probabilistic modeling, and rendering methods. 

I hold a Master's of Mathematics in Computer Science from the [University of Waterloo](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/), where I was supervised by [Yao-liang Yu](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~y328yu) working on Machine Learning Generative Models. I am an alumnus of the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). Before this, I completed an undergraduate degree at the [University of Manitoba](https://umanitoba.ca/) in Applied Mathematics with Computer Science; where I was a member of the [GADA Lab](https://home.cs.umanitoba.ca/~gada/) studying notions of Data Depth, supervised by [Stephane Durocher](https://home.cs.umanitoba.ca/~durocher/).

Outside of research I enjoy cycling, camping, and some amateur photography. I am also an avid reader, biased towards hard sci-fi that provide interesting social political commentary.
