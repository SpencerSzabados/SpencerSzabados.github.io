I'm a current graduate student (2023 - present) at the [University of Waterloo](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/) supervised by [Yao-liang Yu](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~y328yu) working on Machine Learning. My research interests are currently centered around generative modeling with an emphasis on Diffusion Models; I'm also interested in a variety of topics within optimization, probabilistic modeling, and rendering methods. I am also associated with the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). I completed my undergraduate degree at the [University of Manitoba](https://umanitoba.ca/) in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. I was previously a member of the [GADA Lab](https://home.cs.umanitoba.ca/~gada/) studying notions of Data Depth, supervised by [Stephane Durocher](https://home.cs.umanitoba.ca/~durocher/).

Outside of research I enjoy cycling, camping, and some amateur photography. I am also an avid reader, biased towards hard sci-fi that provide interesting social political commentary.
