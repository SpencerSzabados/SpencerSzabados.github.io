# About
This is the (current) repository for the website of Spencer Szabados. This website is used to display my publications, past projects, and the miscellaneous other things I find myself interested in.

# Dependencies  
The al-folio theme is dependent on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for deployment. 

# Code attribution and license
This repository makes use of the [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) theme which is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/blob/master/LICENSE).

Originally, al-folio was based on the [\*folio theme](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) (published by [Lia Bogoev](https://liabogoev.com) and under the MIT license). Since then, it got a full re-write of the styles and many additional features.

The [Medium tutorial](https://medium.com/@carlbettosi/create-a-personal-academic-website-easily-with-github-pages-and-jekyll-minimal-coding-f1115eeb5ab7) written by Carl Bettosi is a great quick start for anyone looking to deploy a personal website using the al-folio theme.
