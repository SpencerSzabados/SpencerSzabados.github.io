I completed a Master's in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo with, Yaoliang Yu, focusing on generative models, and an undergrad in Applied Math and Computer Science at the University of Manitoba, where I worked on data depth in the GADA Lab. I enjoy tackling challenging problems, especially in computational math, applied stats, and numerical methods. Outside of work, I'm an avid reader, mostly on topics relating to human decision making, finance, and sci-fi.","location":{"address":"","postalCode":"","city":"Vancouver","countryCode":"Canada","region":"BC"},"profiles":[{}]},"interests":[{"name":"Mathematics","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag","keywords":["Numerical Analysis","Orthogonal polynomial approximations","Graph Theory","Combinatorial Design"]},{"name":"Computer Science","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag","keywords":["Diffusion Models","Probabilistic Circuits","Probabilistic Modeling","Robotic Planning"]}],"education":[{"institution":"University of British Columbia","location":"BC, Canada","url":"https://www.ubc.ca/","area":"Machine Learning and Generative Modeling","studyType":"Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science","startDate":"2025-09","endDate":""},{"institution":"University of Waterloo","location":"ON, Canada","url":"https://uwaterloo.ca/","area":"Machine Learning and Generative Modeling","studyType":"Masters of Mathematics in Computer Science","startDate":"2023-01","endDate":"2025-01"},{"institution":"University of Manitoba","location":"MB, Canada","url":"https://umanitoba.ca/","area":"Applied Mathematics and Computer Science","studyType":"Bachelors of Science","startDate":"2016-07","endDate":"2022-02"}],"certificates":[{"name":"Front-End Web Development","date":"2020.06","issuer":"Udemy","url":"https://www.udemy.com/course/front-end-web-development/","icon":"fa-solid fa-location-dot"}],"work":[{"name":"Inverted AI","contractType":"Contract, part-time, Hybrid","position":"Research Graduate Intern","startDate":"2025-09","endDate":"","summary":"Research graduate intern for autonomous navigation and planning.","url":"https://www.inverted.ai/home"},{"tag":"coastalcarbon","name":"hum.ai (prev.
