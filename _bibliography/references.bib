The chapter discusses a mathematical model of one such process, known as the 'probably approximately correct’ (or PAC) model. It illustrates how key problems of learning in artificial neural networks can be studied within this framework, presenting theoretical analyses of two important issues: the size of training sample that should be used, and the running time of learning algorithms: sample complexity and computational complexity. There are two sets of concepts inherent in the framework for learning. First, there is the set of concepts derived from the real world that it is proposed to recognize. When a set of concepts is determined in this way, the term concept space is used for it. Secondly, there is the set of concepts that the machine M is capable of recognizing. The set of all concepts which M determines is referred to as its hypothesis space.},

 	abstract = {Many of the classification algorithms developed in the machine learning literature, including the support vector machine and boosting, can be viewed as minimum contrast methods that minimize a convex surrogate of the 0-1 loss function. The convexity makes these algorithms computationally efficient. The use of a surrogate, however, has statistical consequences that must be balanced against the computational virtues of convexity. To study these issues, we provide a general quantitative relationship between the risk as assessed using the 0-1 loss and the risk as assessed using any nonnegative surrogate loss function. We show that this relationship gives nontrivial upper bounds on excess risk under the weakest possible condition on the loss function-that it satisfies a pointwise form of Fisher consistency for classification. The relationship is based on a simple variational transformation of the loss function that is easy to compute in many applications. We also present a refined version of this result in the case of low noise, and show that in this case, strictly convex loss functions lead to faster rates of convergence of the risk than would be implied by standard uniform convergence arguments. Finally, we present applications of our results to the estimation of convergence rates in function classes that are scaled convex hulls of a finite-dimensional base class, with a variety of commonly used loss functions.},

The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown. The statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept
statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theoryand practice, has developed rapidlyin fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.},

Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks. We also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora.},

    title = {Exact Algorithms for Partial Curve Matching via the Fr\'{e}chet Distance},
    abstract = {Curve matching is a fundamental problem that occurs in many applications. In this paper, we study the problem of measuring partial similarity between curves. Specifically, given two curves, we wish to maximize the total length of subcurves that are close to each other, where closeness is measured by the Fr\'{e}chet distance, a common distance measure for curves. The resulting maximal length is called the partial Fr\'{e}chet similarity between the two input curves.Given two polygonal curves P and Q in Rd of size m and n, respectively, we present the first exact algorithm that runs in polynomial time to compute fδ(P, Q), the partial Fr\'{e}chet similarity between P and Q, under the L1 and L∞ norms. Specifically, we formulate the problem of computing fδ(P, Q) as a longest path problem, and solve it in O(mn(m + n) log(mn)) time, under the L1 or L∞ norm, using a "shortest-path map" type decomposition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to study this natural definition of partial curve similarity in the continuous setting (with all points in the curve considered), and present a polynomial-time exact algorithm for it.},

This time complexity is easily shown to be optimal. Within the same asymptotic cost, our algorithm can also construct the subdivision of the plane defined by the segments and compute which segment (if any) lies right above (or below) each intersection and each endpoint. The algorithm has been implemented and performs very well. The storage requirement is on the order of n + k in the worst case, but it is considerably lower in practice. To analyze the complexity of the algorithm, an amortization argument based on a new combinatorial theorem on line arrangements is used.},

In particular, we are able to apply our approach to solve two long-standing problems of computational geometry: one is to obtain a quadratic algorithm for computing the minimum-area triangle with vertices chosen amongn points in the plane; the other is to produce an optimal algorithm for the half-plane range query problem. This problem is to preprocessn points in the plane, so that given a test half-plane, one can efficiently determine all points lying in the half-plane. We describe an optimalO(k + logn) time algorithm for answering such queries, wherek is the number of points to be reported. The algorithm requiresO(n) space andO(n logn) preprocessing time. Both of these results represent significant improvements over the best methods previously known. In addition, we give a number of new combinatorial results related to the computation of line arrangements.},

In addition to providing a definition whose form is more consistent with those of traditional statistical estimators of location, this new definition for the projection median allows many of its geometric properties to be established more easily, as well as enabling new randomized algorithms that compute approximations of the projection median with increased accuracy and efficiency, reducing computation time from to , where denotes the number of random projections sampled.

An SPN is either a univariate distribution, a product of SPNs over disjoint variables, or a weighted sum of SPNs over the same variables. We propose the first algorithm for learning the structure of SPNs that takes full advantage of their expressiveness. At each step, the algorithm attempts to divide the current variables into approximately independent subsets. If successful, it returns the product of recursive calls on the subsets; otherwise it returns the sum of recursive calls on subsets of similar instances from the current training set. A comprehensive empirical study shows that the learned SPNs are typically comparable to graphical models in likelihood but superior in inference speed and accuracy.},

Although a formal definition has been put forward in the literature, there are still several unclarities to be tackled, and further insights to be gained. Herein, a few interesting connections between the wanted properties are found. In particular, it is demonstrated that the conditions needed for some desirable properties to hold are extremely demanding, and virtually impossible to be met for common depths. We establish adaptations of these properties which prove to be still sensible, and more easily met by common functional depths.},

	abstract = {Generalized intersection searching problems are a class of geometric query-retrieval problems where the questions of interest concern the intersection of a query object with aggregates of geometric objects (rather than with individual objects.) This class contains, as a special case, the well-studied class of standard intersection searching problems and is rich in applications. Unfortunately, the solutions known for the standard problems do not yield efficient solutions to the generalized problems. Recently, efficient solutions have been given for generalized problems where the input and query objects are iso-oriented (i.e., axes-parallel) or where the aggregates satisfy additional properties (e.g., connectedness). In this paper, efficient algorithms are given for several generalized problems involving non-iso-oriented objects. These problems include: generalized halfspace range searching, segment intersection searching, triangle stabbing, and triangle range searching. The techniques used include: computing suitable sparse representations of the input, persistent data structures, and filtering search.},

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

Interestingly, our proofs indicate that existence of a nondegenerate observable with a conformally-invariant scaling limit seems sufficient to deduce the required condition. Our paper serves as an important step in establishing the convergence of Ising and FK Ising interfaces to SLE curves; moreover, the setup is adapted to branching interface trees, conjecturally describing the full interface picture by a collection of branching SLEs.},

We show how to preprocess $n$ arcs in time $O(n^{2+epsilon})$ into a data structure of size $O(n^{2+epsilon})$, for any $epsilon >0$, such that the $k$ arcs intersecting a query segment can be counted in time $O(log n)$ or reported in time $O(log n+k)$. This problem was extensively studied in restricted settings (e.g., amidst segments, circles or circular arcs), but no solution with comparable performance was previously presented for the general case of possibly intersecting algebraic arcs. Our data structure for the general case matches or improves (sometimes by an order of magnitude) the size of the best previously presented solutions for the special cases.As an immediate application of this result, we obtain an efficient data structure for the triangular windowing problem, which is a generalization of triangular range searching. As another application, the first substantially sub-quadratic algorithm for a red-blue intersection counting problem is derived. We also describe simple data structures for segment intersection searching among disjoint arcs, and ray shooting among algebraic arcs.},

For each combination of interest, we identify a representation manifold, endow it with a Riemannian metric, and outline tools for computing sample statistics on these manifolds. An important characteristic of the chosen representations is that the ensuing comparison and modeling of curves is invariant to how the curves are parameterized. The nuisance variables, including parameterization, are removed by forming quotient spaces under appropriate group actions. In the case of shape analysis, the resulting spaces are quotient spaces of Hilbert spheres, and we derive certain wrapped truncated normal densities for capturing variability in observed curves. We demonstrate these models using both artificial data and real data involving DT-MRI fiber tracts from multiple subjects and protein backbones from the Shape Retrieval Contest of Non-rigid 3D Models (SHREC) 2010 database.},

	title = {A Survey of Procedural Noise Functions},
	abstract = {Abstract Procedural noise functions are widely used in computer graphics, from off-line rendering in movie production to interactive video games. The ability to add complex and intricate details at low memory and authoring cost is one of its main attractions. This survey is motivated by the inherent importance of noise in graphics, the widespread use of noise in industry and the fact that many recent research developments justify the need for an up-to-date survey. Our goal is to provide both a valuable entry point into the field of procedural noise functions, as well as a comprehensive view of the field to the informed reader. In this report, we cover procedural noise functions in all their aspects. We outline recent advances in research on this topic, discussing and comparing recent and well-established methods. We first formally define procedural noise functions based on stochastic processes and then classify and review existing procedural noise functions. We discuss how procedural noise functions are used for modelling and how they are applied to surfaces. We then introduce analysis tools and apply them to evaluate and compare the major approaches to noise generation. We finally identify several directions for future work.},

These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech.},

	title = {Efficient Ray Tracing of Volume Data},
	abstract = {Volume rendering is a technique for visualizing sampled scalar or vector fields of three spatial dimensions without fitting geometric primitives to the data. A subset of these techniques generates images by computing 2-D projections of a colored semitransparent volume, where the color and opacity at each point are derived from the data using local operators. Since all voxels participate in the generation of each image, rendering time grows linearly with the size of the dataset. This paper presents a front-to-back image-order volume-rendering algorithm and discusses two techniques for improving its performance. The first technique employs a pyramid of binary volumes to encode spatial coherence present in the data, and the second technique uses an opacity threshold to adaptively terminate ray tracing. Although the actual time saved depends on the data, speedups of an order of magnitude have been observed for datasets of useful size and complexity. Examples from two applications are given: medical imaging and molecular graphics.},

Here we present a hybrid network of convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) network for river flow prediction. The hybridization enables accurate identification of the spatial and temporal features in precipitation. A shortcut layer is used as an additional channel of passing input features through the deep network to increase feature diversity. The flows in Hun River Basin, China are predicted using the trained hybrid network and are compared with the results from the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The results demonstrate the learning efficiency of the hybrid network is greatly affected by its structure and parameters, including the number of convolutional layers and LSTM cell layers, the step size of pooling and training data size. Further, the shortcut layer can effectively solve the diversity reduction problem in a deep network. The hybrid network is shown to have a similar predictive performance to SWAT but is superior in wet seasons due to its nonlinear learning ability. This study shows that the hybrid network has great promise in learning nonlinear and high spatio-temporal variability in river flow forecasting.}",

SPNs are a propositional architecture, treating the instances as independent and identically distributed. In this paper, we introduce Relational Sum-Product Networks (RSPNs), a new tractable first-order probabilistic architecture. RSPNs generalize SPNs by modeling a set of instances jointly, allowing them to influence each other’s probability distributions, as well as modeling probabilities of relations between objects. We also present LearnRSPN, the first algorithm for learning high-treewidth tractable statistical relational models. LearnRSPN is a recursive top-down structure learning algorithm for RSPNs, based on Gens and Domingos’ LearnSPN algorithm for propositional SPN learning. We evaluate the algorithm on three datasets; the RSPN learning algorithm outperforms Markov Logic Networks in both running time and predictive accuracy.},

The model is essentially an extension of procedural solid texture synthesis, but evaluated throughout a volumetric region instead of only at surfaces.We have been able to obtain visually realistic representations of such shape+texture (hypertexture) phenomena as hair, fur, fire, glass, fluid flow and erosion effects. We show how this is done, first by describing a set of base level functions to provide basic texture and control capability, then by combining these to synthesize various phenomena.Hypertexture exists within an intermediate region between object and not-object. We introduce a notion of generalized boolean shape operators to combine shapes having such a region.Rendering is accomplished by ray marching from the eye point through the volume to accumulate opacity along each ray. We have implemented our hypertexture rendering algorithms on a traditional serial computer, a distributed network of computers and a coarse-grain MIMD computer. Extensions to the rendering technique incorporating refraction and reflection effects are discussed.},

Properties of the proposed depths, such as invariance and consistency, can be established. A simulation study shows the robustness of this new definition of depth and the advantages of using a multivariate depth versus the marginal depths for detecting outliers.

	title = {On the Concept of Depth for Functional Data},
	abstract = {The statistical analysis of functional data is a growing need in many research areas. In particular, a robust methodology is important to study curves, which are the output of many experiments in applied statistics. As a starting point for this robust analysis, we propose, analyze, and apply a new definition of depth for functional observations based on the graphic representation of the curves. Given a collection of functions, it establishes the "centrality" of an observation and provides a natural center-outward ordering of the sample curves. Robust statistics, such as the median function or a trimmed mean function, can be defined from this depth definition. Its finite-dimensional version provides a new depth for multivariate data that is computationally feasible and useful for studying high-dimensional observations. Thus, this new depth is also suitable for complex observations such as microarray data, images, and those arising in some recent marketing and financial studies. Natural properties of these new concepts are established and the uniform consistency of the sample depth is proved. Simulation results show that the corresponding depth based trimmed mean presents better performance than other possible location estimators proposed in the literature for some contaminated models. Data depth can be also used to screen for outliers. The ability of the new notions of depth to detect "shape" outliers is presented. Several real datasets are considered to illustrate this new concept of depth, including applications to microarray observations, weather data, and growth curves. Finally, through this depth, we generalize to functions the Wilcoxon rank sum test. It allows testing whether two groups of curves come from the same population. This functional rank test when applied to children growth curves shows different growth patterns for boys and girls.},

But this type of complex motion is rarely seen in computer animation. This paper explores an approach based on simulation as an alternative to scripting the paths of each bird individually. The simulated flock is an elaboration of a particle systems, with the simulated birds being the particles. The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is created by a distributed behavioral model much like that at work in a natural flock; the birds choose their own course. Each simulated bird is implemented as an independent actor that navigates according to its local perception of the dynamic environment, the laws of simulated physics that rule its motion, and a set of behaviors programmed into it by the "animator." The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is the result of the dense interaction of the relatively simple behaviors of the individual simulated birds.},

	abstract = {By replacing the sigmoid activation function often used in neural networks with an exponential function, a probabilistic neural network (PNN) that can compute nonlinear decision boundaries which approach the Bayes optimal is formed. Alternate activation functions having similar properties are also discussed. A fourlayer neural network of the type proposed can map any input pattern to any number of classifications. The decision boundaries can be modified in real-time using new data as they become available, and can be implemented using artificial hardware “neurons” that operate entirely in parallel. Provision is also made for estimating the probability and reliability of a classification as well as making the decision. The technique offers a tremendous speed advantage for problems in which the incremental adaptation time of back propagation is a significant fraction of the total computation time. For one application, the PNN paradigm was 200,000 times faster than back-propagation.},

In this classifier, called the evidential deep-learning classifier, convolutional and pooling layers first extract high-dimensional features from input data. The features are then converted into mass functions and aggregated by Dempster’s rule in a DS layer. Finally, an expected utility layer performs set-valued classification based on mass functions. We propose an end-to-end learning strategy for jointly updating the network parameters. Additionally, an approach for selecting partial multi-class acts is proposed. Experiments on image recognition, signal processing, and semantic-relationship classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed combination of deep CNN, DS layer, and expected utility layer makes it possible to improve classification accuracy and to make cautious decisions by assigning confusing patterns to multi-class sets.},

Furthermore, we give measures that exist only for a group of trajectories, like density and formation stability. We also show that it may be possible to define new measures by combining trajectory data with data from other sources, such as the environment where the entities move. Finally, we discuss several tasks: settlement selection, visualization and segmentation, where measures on groups of trajectories are necessary.},

	title = {Projection-Based Depth Functions and Associated Medians},
	abstract = {A class of projection-based depth functions is introduced and studied. These projection-based depth functions possess desirable properties of statistical depth functions and their sample versions possess strong and order √n uniform consistency. Depth regions and contours induced from projection-based depth functions are investigated. Structural properties of depth regions and contours and general continuity and convergence results of sample depth regions are obtained. Affine equivariant multivariate medians induced from projection-based depth functions are probed. The limiting distributions as well as the strong and order √n consistency of the sample projection medians are established. The finite sample performance of projection medians is compared with that of a leading depth-induced median, the Tukey halfspace median (induced from the Tukey halfspace depth function). It turns out that, with appropriate choices of univariate location and scale estimators, the projection medians have a very high finite sample breakdown point and relative efficiency, much higher than those of the halfspace median. Based on the results obtained, it is found that projection depth functions and projection medians behave very well overall compared with their competitors and consequently are good alternatives to statistical depth functions and affine equivariant multivariate location estimators, respectively.},

	title = {General Notions of Statistical Depth Function},
 	abstract = {Statistical depth functions are being formulated ad hoc with increasing popularity in nonparametric inference for multivariate data. Here we introduce several general structures for depth functions, classify many existing examples as special cases, and establish results on the possession, or lack thereof, of four key properties desirable for depth functions in general. Roughly speaking, these properties may be described as: affine invariance, maximality at center, monotonicity relative to deepest point, and vanishing at infinity. This provides a more systematic basis for selection of a depth function. In particular, from these and other considerations it is found that the halfspace depth behaves very well overall in comparison with various competitors.},
