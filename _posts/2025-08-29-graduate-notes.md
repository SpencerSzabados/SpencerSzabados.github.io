As I'm about to begin a PhD at UBC, it's fitting I wrap up some notes from my past degree.

---

Today I finally got around to cleaning up my Obsidian markup notes that I made over the course of my Master's degree in Computer Science. After stripping out a lot of research notes, I've put them up on [GitHub](https://github.com/SpencerSzabados/Coeus) for anyone's reference.

These notes primarily focus on topics within Machine Learning and Computer Vision, but also contain entries for topics within Mathematics and Statistics. I tend not to go into detail on the implementation specifics (PyTorch, CUDA kernels, etc.) for the various methods/algorithms discussed, as these are best learned from studying public repositories or implementing them yourself; rather, I concentrate on the mathematics of the methods. Besides, if I were to include notes on the engineering work behind getting many of these methods to function, the notes would likely be incomprehensible.

If you find any errors in my notes please submit a PR and I'll try to find the time to look it over.
